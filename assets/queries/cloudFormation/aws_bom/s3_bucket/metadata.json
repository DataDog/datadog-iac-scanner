  "descriptionText": "This rule inventories S3 buckets and key configuration details to help detect buckets that are publicly accessible or lack server-side encryption, both of which can lead to unauthorized data access or exposure. It inspects resources of type AWS::S3::Bucket and records the AccessControl (ACL), PublicAccessBlockConfiguration (including BlockPublicAcls and BlockPublicPolicy), any associated AWS::S3::BucketPolicy, and server-side encryption settings (BucketEncryption). Buckets with non-private ACLs, PublicAccessBlock settings that do not block public ACLs/policies, associated public bucket policies, or missing encryption will be reported in the BOM output so you can identify and remediate risky storage configurations.",
