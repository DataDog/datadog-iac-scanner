  "descriptionText": "Missing or unmanaged SNS topics can hide messaging channels that are publicly accessible or lack server-side encryption, increasing the risk of unauthorized notifications or data exposure. This rule enumerates CloudFormation `AWS::SNS::Topic` resources to record each topic’s name, its associated `AWS::SNS::TopicPolicy` (checked via the Topics property) to determine accessibility, and its encryption setting (e.g., `KmsMasterKeyId`) for BOM reporting. Resources without an attached TopicPolicy or without a KMS key will be reflected in the bill-of-materials output so operators can quickly identify topics that may require access restriction or encryption.",
