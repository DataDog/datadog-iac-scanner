  "descriptionText": "DynamoDB tables should be inventoried for network accessibility and server-side encryption because public access or missing encryption increases the risk of unauthorized access and data exposure. This rule inspects CloudFormation resources of type AWS::DynamoDB::Table and evaluates accessibility by examining AWS::EC2::VPCEndpoint resources' Properties.PolicyDocument; a VPCEndpoint policy with an Allow effect, any principal (including '*'), and DynamoDB actions targeting '*' or the table's ARN will classify the table as public. It also reports encryption state by checking Properties.SSESpecification.SSEEnabled—tables with SSEEnabled != true are reported as unencrypted; tables without a matching VPCEndpoint policy are reported as private, and policies that exist but do not grant public access are annotated as having a policy.",
