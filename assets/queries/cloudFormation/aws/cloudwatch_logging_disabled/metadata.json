  "descriptionText": "Route 53 hosted zones should have query logging enabled so DNS queries are recorded for detection, forensics, and troubleshooting. Without query logs, DNS-based attacks and misconfigurations are harder to detect and investigate.\n\n In CloudFormation, `AWS::Route53::HostedZone` resources must include the `QueryLoggingConfig` property with a valid `CloudWatchLogsLogGroupArn` pointing to a CloudWatch Logs log group to receive DNS query logs. Ensure the referenced log group exists and that permissions allow Route 53 to publish logs. Resources missing `QueryLoggingConfig` will be flagged.\n\nSecure configuration example:\n\n```yaml\nMyHostedZone:\n  Type: AWS::Route53::HostedZone\n  Properties:\n    Name: example.com\n    QueryLoggingConfig:\n      CloudWatchLogsLogGroupArn: arn:aws:logs:us-east-1:123456789012:log-group:/aws/route53/example\n```",
