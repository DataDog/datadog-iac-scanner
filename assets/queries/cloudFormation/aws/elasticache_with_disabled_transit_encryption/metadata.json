  "descriptionText": "Amazon ElastiCache Redis replication groups must have in-transit encryption enabled to protect data exchanged between clients and cluster nodes from interception or tampering, preserving confidentiality and integrity.\n \n For CloudFormation resources of type `AWS::ElastiCache::ReplicationGroup` with `Engine` set to `redis`, the `TransitEncryptionEnabled` property must be defined and set to `true`. Resources missing `TransitEncryptionEnabled` or with `TransitEncryptionEnabled` set to `false` will be flagged as insecure. \n \n Secure configuration example:\n\n```yaml\nMyRedisReplicationGroup:\n  Type: AWS::ElastiCache::ReplicationGroup\n  Properties:\n    Engine: redis\n    TransitEncryptionEnabled: true\n    # other required properties...\n```",
