  "category": "Networking and Firewall",
  "descriptionText": "Opening port ranges for GameLift fleet instances increases the attack surface by exposing multiple ports instead of a single intended port. This can allow additional network-based attacks and makes it harder to reason about allowed traffic.\n \n For `AWS::GameLift::Fleet` resources, each entry in the `Properties.EC2InboundPermissions` array must set `FromPort` and `ToPort` to the same numeric value so only a single port is opened. Resources with `EC2InboundPermissions` entries where `FromPort` is not equal to `ToPort` will be flagged. Ensure both properties are defined and equal for every entry.\n\nSecure configuration example:\n\n```yaml\nMyGameLiftFleet:\n  Type: AWS::GameLift::Fleet\n  Properties:\n    EC2InboundPermissions:\n      - FromPort: 3478\n        ToPort: 3478\n        IpRange: 0.0.0.0/0\n        Protocol: UDP\n```",
