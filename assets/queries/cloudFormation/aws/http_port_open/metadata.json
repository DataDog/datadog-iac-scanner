  "descriptionText": "Security groups should not allow HTTP (port `80`) ingress from the entire internet because it exposes web services to unauthenticated access and increases the attack surface for automated scanning and exploitation.\n \n In CloudFormation, inspect `AWS::EC2::SecurityGroup` resources' `SecurityGroupIngress` entries and ensure none have `CidrIp` = `0.0.0.0/0` or `CidrIpv6` = `::/0`, combined with `IpProtocol` set to `tcp`, `-1`, or `6`, and a port range that includes `80`. This rule flags ingress entries where `FromPort <= 80` and `ToPort >= 80`, indicating port `80` is open to the world.\n \n To remediate, restrict source CIDRs to trusted ranges, place services behind a load balancer or VPN, or require encrypted access (HTTPS/port `443`) instead of allowing global HTTP.\n\nSecure configuration example (restrict to specific CIDR):\n\n```yaml\nMySecurityGroup:\n  Type: AWS::EC2::SecurityGroup\n  Properties:\n    GroupDescription: Web server security group\n    VpcId: !Ref MyVPC\n    SecurityGroupIngress:\n      - IpProtocol: tcp\n        FromPort: 443\n        ToPort: 443\n        CidrIp: 10.0.0.0/16\n```",
