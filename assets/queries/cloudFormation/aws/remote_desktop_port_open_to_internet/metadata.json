  "descriptionText": "Opening the Remote Desktop service (TCP port `3389`) to the public internet exposes Windows hosts to automated scanning and brute‑force attacks and enables unauthorized remote access that can lead to credential compromise and lateral movement. In AWS CloudFormation, inspect `AWS::EC2::SecurityGroup` resources' `Properties.SecurityGroupIngress` entries and flag any ingress where `CidrIp` is `0.0.0.0/0` or `CidrIpv6` is `::/0`, `IpProtocol` is TCP (`tcp`, `-1`, or `6`), and the port range includes `3389` (`FromPort` <= `3389` and `ToPort` >= `3389`). Replace global access with specific trusted CIDR ranges or remove the rule. Provide remote access via a bastion host, VPN, or AWS Systems Manager Session Manager instead of exposing RDP directly. \n \n Secure example restricting RDP to a single trusted IP:\n\n```yaml\nMySecurityGroup:\n  Type: AWS::EC2::SecurityGroup\n  Properties:\n    GroupDescription: Allow RDP from trusted admin network only\n    SecurityGroupIngress:\n      - IpProtocol: tcp\n        FromPort: 3389\n        ToPort: 3389\n        CidrIp: 203.0.113.4/32\n```",
