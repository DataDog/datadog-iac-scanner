  "queryName": "API Gateway with invalid compression",
  "severity": "LOW",
  "category": "Encryption",
  "descriptionText": "API Gateway should have a valid compression threshold to ensure large responses are compressed, which reduces bandwidth use and helps limit data exposure and amplification risks from large uncompressed payloads. The `AWS::ApiGateway::RestApi` resource must include the `Properties.MinimumCompressionSize` property as an integer between `0` and `10485759` (inclusive). Resources missing this property or with values less than `0` or greater than `10485759` will be flagged.\n\nSecure configuration example:\n\n```yaml\nMyApi:\n  Type: AWS::ApiGateway::RestApi\n  Properties:\n    Name: MyApi\n    MinimumCompressionSize: 1024\n```",
