  "severity": "HIGH",
  "category": "Encryption",
  "descriptionText": "Kinesis streams must have server-side encryption enabled to protect data at rest and reduce the risk of sensitive records being exposed through compromised storage, snapshots, or insider access. In AWS CloudFormation, `AWS::Kinesis::Stream` resources must include the `Properties.StreamEncryption` object with `EncryptionType` and `KeyId` defined. Resources missing `StreamEncryption` or with `StreamEncryption.EncryptionType` or `StreamEncryption.KeyId` undefined will be flagged as insecure.\n\nSecure CloudFormation example:\n\n```yaml\nMyKinesisStream:\n  Type: AWS::Kinesis::Stream\n  Properties:\n    Name: my-stream\n    ShardCount: 1\n    StreamEncryption:\n      EncryptionType: KMS\n      KeyId: arn:aws:kms:us-east-1:123456789012:key/abcd1234-ef56-7890-ab12-3456cdef7890\n```",
