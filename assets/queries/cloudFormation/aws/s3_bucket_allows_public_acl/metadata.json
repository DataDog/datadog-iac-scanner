  "severity": "MEDIUM",
  "category": "Access Control",
  "descriptionText": "S3 buckets should block public ACLs to prevent objects from being granted public access via ACLs. Public ACLs can lead to unintended data exposure. For `AWS::S3::Bucket` resources, `Properties.PublicAccessBlockConfiguration.BlockPublicAcls` must be set to `true`. Resources missing `PublicAccessBlockConfiguration`, or with `BlockPublicAcls: false`, will be flagged. Consider also enabling other `PublicAccessBlockConfiguration` flags (for example, `IgnorePublicAcls`, `BlockPublicPolicy`, and `RestrictPublicBuckets`) for broader protection.\n\nSecure configuration example:\n\n```yaml\nMyBucket:\n  Type: AWS::S3::Bucket\n  Properties:\n    BucketName: my-bucket\n    PublicAccessBlockConfiguration:\n      BlockPublicAcls: true\n```",
