  "descriptionText": "Declaring an AWS SimpleDB domain is discouraged because SimpleDB is a legacy service that lacks many modern security and operational controls. This increases the risk of data exposure and creates maintenance and compliance challenges.\n\nCloudFormation resources with `Type: \"AWS::SDB::Domain\"` must not be defined. Any resource of that type will be flagged by this rule. Use supported services such as Amazon DynamoDB, Amazon RDS, or Amazon S3 with server-side encryption and appropriate IAM controls as secure alternatives.\n\nSecure alternative (DynamoDB instead of SimpleDB):\n\n```yaml\nMyTable:\n  Type: AWS::DynamoDB::Table\n  Properties:\n    TableName: my-table\n    AttributeDefinitions:\n      - AttributeName: id\n        AttributeType: S\n    KeySchema:\n      - AttributeName: id\n        KeyType: HASH\n    BillingMode: PAY_PER_REQUEST\n    SSESpecification:\n      SSEEnabled: true\n```",
