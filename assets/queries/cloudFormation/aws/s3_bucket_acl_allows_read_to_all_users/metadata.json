  "severity": "HIGH",
  "category": "Access Control",
  "descriptionText": "S3 buckets with a publicly readable ACL allow any internet user to list and download objects. This can lead to data leakage, accidental exposure of sensitive information, and compliance violations. This rule checks `AWS::S3::Bucket` resources and flags buckets whose `Properties.AccessControl` is set to `PublicRead`. To remediate, set `AccessControl` to `Private` or remove the ACL and enable S3 Block Public Access controls. If you must serve public content, use a CDN (CloudFront) with an origin access identity or a narrowly scoped bucket policy instead of a public ACL.\n\nSecure CloudFormation example:\n\n```yaml\nMySecureBucket:\n  Type: AWS::S3::Bucket\n  Properties:\n    BucketName: my-secure-bucket\n    AccessControl: Private\n    PublicAccessBlockConfiguration:\n      BlockPublicAcls: true\n      IgnorePublicAcls: true\n      BlockPublicPolicy: true\n      RestrictPublicBuckets: true\n```",
