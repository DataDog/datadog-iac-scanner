  "descriptionText": "Serverless APIs should enable response compression by configuring `MinimumCompressionSize` to reduce response sizes, lower bandwidth costs, and limit the risk of backend resource exhaustion from large uncompressed payloads. The `MinimumCompressionSize` property on `AWS::Serverless::Api` resources must be defined as an integer between `0` and `10485759` (that is, greater than `-1` and less than `10485760`). Resources missing this property or with values less than `0` or greater than `10485759` will be flagged. A typical secure configuration sets a threshold in bytes (for example, `1024`) to compress responses larger than that size:\n\n```yaml\nMyApi:\n  Type: AWS::Serverless::Api\n  Properties:\n    StageName: prod\n    MinimumCompressionSize: 1024\n```",
