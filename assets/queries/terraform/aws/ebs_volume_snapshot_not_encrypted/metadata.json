  "severity": "HIGH",
  "category": "Encryption",
  "descriptionText": "EBS volume snapshots should be encrypted to protect sensitive data at rest from unauthorized access. When an EBS snapshot is unencrypted, sensitive information is potentially exposed if accessed by malicious actors. The security impact includes potential data breaches, compliance violations, and unauthorized data access even if the original volume is no longer in use.\n\nTo ensure proper encryption, create your EBS snapshots with encryption enabled. For example:\n\n```\nresource \"aws_ebs_snapshot\" \"secure_example\" {\n  volume_id = aws_ebs_volume.negative1.id\n  encrypted = true\n}\n```",
