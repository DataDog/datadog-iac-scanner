  "queryName": "Permissive access to create pods",
  "severity": "MEDIUM",
  "category": "Access Control",
  "descriptionText": "The permission to create `pods` in a cluster should be restricted because it allows privilege escalation. This rule inspects `kubernetes_role` and `kubernetes_cluster_role` resources and reports when a rule's `verbs` contains `create` while its `resources` contains `pods` or a wildcard value. It also flags cases where `verbs` or `resources` contain a wildcard (for example, `*`) in combination with `pods`, since those broaden access and can enable pod creation. Restricting these permissions reduces the risk of workloads obtaining elevated privileges.",
