  "category": "Availability",
  "descriptionText": "Deployments should be assigned a `PodDisruptionBudget` to ensure high availability. For `kubernetes_deployment` resources with `spec.replicas > 1`, the deployment's `spec.selector.match_labels` should be targeted by a `kubernetes_pod_disruption_budget`. This ensures the deployment's selector labels are referenced by the `PodDisruptionBudget`, preventing excessive pod evictions during voluntary disruptions.",
