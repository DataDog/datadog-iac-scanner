  "severity": "HIGH",
  "category": "Networking and Firewall",
  "descriptionText": "An unknown port, such as `24` or `111`, is open to the public on the `tcp`, `udp`, or `all` protocol. This occurs when `port_range` includes ports not present in the known ports map and `cidr_ip` is set to `0.0.0.0/0`. Such security group rules expose services to the entire Internet and should be avoided.",
