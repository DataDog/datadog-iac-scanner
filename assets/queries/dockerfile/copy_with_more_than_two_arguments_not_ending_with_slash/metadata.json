  "descriptionText": "`COPY` commands that reference a storage path must end directory arguments with a trailing slash so the command targets the intended directory prefix rather than a single object. Omitting the slash can lead to ambiguous file selection and accidental inclusion or exclusion of files, causing data integrity problems or unintended data exposure.\n\nThis check inspects `COPY` commands with more than two arguments and verifies that the final argument (the source path) ends with a `/` character. Resources where the command has more than two elements and the last element does not end with `/` will be flagged. Ensure the source path is explicitly a directory by including the trailing slash. For example:\n\n```\nCOPY INTO my_table FROM 's3://my-bucket/path/' CREDENTIALS=...;\n```",
