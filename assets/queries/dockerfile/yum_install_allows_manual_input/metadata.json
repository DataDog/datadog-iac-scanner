  "descriptionText": "`RUN` instructions that invoke `yum install` without a non-interactive flag can prompt for user input during image builds, causing automated CI/CD pipelines to hang or produce inconsistent images when builds are completed manually.\n\nCheck Dockerfile `RUN` commands for invocations of `yum install` (including `groupinstall` or `localinstall`). The command must include a non-interactive flag such as `-y`, `yes`, or `--assumeyes`. This rule flags `RUN` entries where a `yum` install is detected but none of those flags are present. It applies to both single-string `RUN` commands and list-form `RUN` arguments. \n\nSecure example:\n\n```dockerfile\nRUN yum -y install curl\n```",
